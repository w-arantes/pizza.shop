## End-to-End Testing

We use Playwright for end-to-end (e2e) testing to ensure the quality and reliability of our application. Playwright allows us to automate browser interactions and verify that our application behaves as expected.

### Running e2e Tests

To run the e2e tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

This will start the Playwright test UI and execute all the e2e tests defined in the project.
